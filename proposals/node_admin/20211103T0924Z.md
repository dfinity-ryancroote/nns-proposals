Description:
This revision includes a fix for a timeout in the `ic-replica` start that we hit with revision `f2fc23733b52c53c8f1cfc05eba508c05e87c8b1` on the app 2 (`qxesv`) subnet during the release process. The fix consists of: 1) reducing the verbosity during the service start, and 2) increasing the timeout. A better fix will be provided in the near future but this should be sufficient to unblock the release rollout.
