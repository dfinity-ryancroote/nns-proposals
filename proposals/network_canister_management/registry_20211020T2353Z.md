## Release notes

### New features
* Pagination now used to limit payload sizes for `get_changes_since(…)` (similar to the certified equivalent)
* New proposal type to remove subnet records from the registry

### Improvements
* The following fields have been added to subnet records:
	* `max_block_payload_size`
	* `max_instructions_per_message`
	* `max_instructions_per_round`
	* `max_instructions_per_install_code`
* The following fields have been removed from subnet records:
	* `initial_dkg_transcript`
* General comment updates, refactors and cleanups for code clarity, especially around invariants
* The `authz` pattern is no longer used in this canister; it was used only for controlling access to `atomic_mutate(…)`. Instead, we hardcode that only the governance canister and the root canister can mutate the registry
	* Note that the authz data still exists in the canister's stable memory, but will be deleted in a subsequent upgrade
* `get_value()` response error code changed in the case of a malformed message (it previously mistakenly returned `KeyNotPresent`)
* Earlier panic when checking invariants for subnet membership
* Additional checks to defend against races in subnet recovery
