## Release notes

Seed allotments that were unclaimed after 6 months were going to be swept to a foundation-controlled neuron, which would allow the foundation to arbitrate claims by those who say they lost their keys, and forward them on appropriately. Owing to difficulties it has encountered, the foundation realizes it cannot play this role.

This proposal removes the sweep mechanism, except for four participants that have already been successfully processed by the foundation. In the future, an NNS update could make it possible for the NNS, which runs under the control of the decentralized community, to perform this role itself.

### New features
* Change the forwarding functionality to only forward the whitelisted accounts.
