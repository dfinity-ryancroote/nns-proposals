## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to b434acea3831e4317cf20c26488f1d31570dd35b to add security headers and CAPTCHA, and improve some of the authentication and anchor creation flows.

## Rationale:

This is a fairly big upgrade that includes a lot of improvements since November 15th:

* We now warn the user if they are trying to use a seed phrase for the wrong anchor (by comparing the first digits if they exist)
* The seed phrase itself is _not_ translated by Chrome anymore, even if the user has enabled page translation.
* The "recovery" warning is now less dramatic for non-Safari users, and it is made clear to the user that they can skip adding a recovery.
* The "recovery" warning is now more concise (and precise) for Safari users.
* The user is now nudged to write down their newly created anchors.
* A CAPTCHA challenge is introduced during anchor creation.
* Security headers are added when serving assets.
* Various code and typo fixes. For the full list of Pull Requests, see below.
