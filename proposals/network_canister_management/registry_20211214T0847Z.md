## Release notes

## New features
* New endpoint which calculates and returns the monthly Node Provider rewards.
* Pruning in post-upgrade hook can now help with removing stale/irrelevant records.
  * This feature is used to remove the deprecated `xdr_per_icp` key from the Registry store.

### Improvements
* Additional invariant checks added to the replica version field in unassigned node config records.
* `MAX_NUM_SSH_KEYS` for unassigned nodes config is now `100`.
* `get_versions_since` now returns a variable-size paginated response instead of a hardcoded amount of 1000 deltas.
