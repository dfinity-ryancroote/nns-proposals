Wasm hash: 239758d14a896d67f6068fa8063881d65e1273130a1c236cb61eb1e36d418dcd (https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/runs/4337188802?check_suite_focus=true)

## Change Log:

* Switch mainnet to using the HTML renderer for all browsers, rather than only for mobile browsers. This has shown to resolve flickering and rendering issues observed by Monterey and iPads running iOS15. The previous upgrade only switched the renderer in the testnet setup and not production.
