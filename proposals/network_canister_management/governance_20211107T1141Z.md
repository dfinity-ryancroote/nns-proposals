## Release notes

### New features

* Wait for quiet:

Currently proposals require absolute majority to be adopted, meaning a proposal needs to
collect yeses amounting to more than 50% of the total voting power for it to be adopted.

This proposal introduces an initial version of wait-for-quiet: a means of adopting proposals without
requiring absolute majority by having a dynamic proposal deadline that is extended if the proposal is controversial.

For a proposal to be adopted in this way, it first needs to collect more yeses than nos and at least
3% of the total voting power for yes. If at the end of the (dynamic) deadline this is the case, then the proposal is adopted.
