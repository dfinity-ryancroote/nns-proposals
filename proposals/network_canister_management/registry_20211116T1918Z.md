## Proposal to Upgrade the Registry Canister

### Proposer: Dfinity Foundation
### New Wasm Hash: // wasm hash
### Target canister: rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai

## Release notes

## New features
* Add `ecdsa_config` field to Subnet records (corresponding to the respective feature flag)
* Add fields for SSH access to Subnet records. Permissions are for "readonly" and "backup" access.
* New record introduced for SSH access to unassigned nodes. Permissions are for "readonly" and "backup" access.
* P2P gossip behavior was changes; the `relay_config`, `GossipAdvertRelayConfig`, and `relay_percentage` Subnet record fields and payload structs have been replaced by the more agnostic `advert_config`, `best_effort_percentage`, and `GossipAdvertConfig`.

### Improvements
* Changes to the algorithm that the Registry uses to certify deltas. It doesn't build the hash tree from scratch every time anymore. A merklized `RbTree` provided by the `ic-certified-map` library is used instead. This changes the complexity of update certification from O(|updates|) to
O(log(|updates|)). The tree still needs to be built from scratch after an upgrade, however.
